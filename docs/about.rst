About PyMARE
============

PyMARE does meta-analyses and meta-regressions in Python.

PyMARE has largely been conceived and developed as support for `NiMARE`_, a library for performing neuroimaging meta-analyses.
As such, PyMARE provides only a small subset of the functionality of other meta-analysis libraries, such as `metafor`_.
If you need to perform a meta-analysis that is not supported by PyMARE, we suggest using `metafor`_ instead.

    If you want to see where PyMARE fits within the NeuroStore 2.0 ecosystem, check out
